# muiMaterial <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="138" />

`muiMaterial` brings Material UI, the world's most popular React UI framework, to R and Shiny. It is designed to be used with AI coding assistants like [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code).

## Why using it?

#### Give your dashboards a unique look

Want to go beyond the standardised layout used by most Shiny dashboards?

If Shiny apps look all the same, it is because most use Bootstrap. Replacing it with Material UI will take your dashboards to the next level.

Developed by the company MUI, [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/) is probably the most popular React components library globally. `muiMaterial` allows access to its vast library of UI tools, so you can create fully customized dashboards and websites in R.

For example, launch a basic dashboard (live [here](https://lgnbhl-muimaterial-simple-dashboard.share.connect.posit.cloud)):

```r
# remotes::install_github("lgnbhl/muiMaterial")
muiMaterial::muiMaterialExample("dashboard-simple")
```

Or have a look at the R replica of the official MUI dashboard template (live [here](https://lgnbhl-muimaterial-mui-template-dashboard.share.connect.posit.cloud/)):

```r
muiMaterial::muiMaterialExample("mui-template-dashboard")
```

#### Built for AI-assisted development

Material UI (MUI) is the world's most popular React UI framework. This means AI tools like Claude, ChatGPT, or GitHub Copilot have been trained on enormous amounts of MUI code, which make they are so good using it. All you have to do is to ask them to adapt MUI React code into R code using `muiMaterial`.

**Components mirror R functions.** Each MUI component maps directly to an R function with the same name and arguments. React's `<Button variant="contained" />` becomes `Button(variant = "contained")` in R. No React knowledge is needed as the syntax will feel immediately familiar.

**Styling is just an R list.** The `sx` argument accepts a named list of CSS properties. Describe what you want to an AI assistant, and it will write the `sx` list for you:

```r
# Prompt an LLM: "a Card with blue background, white text, padding and rounded corners"
Card(
  sx = list(
    bgcolor = "blue",
    color = "white",
    borderRadius = 3,
    p = 3
  ),
  Typography("Hello!", variant = "h5")
)
```

You do not need to know React or CSS. Just describe what you want and let an AI assistant generate the code.

#### Building custom components easily

Creating custom UI elements is simple. Here's an example of a stat card:

```r
Card(
  sx = list(p = 3),
  Typography("Material UI weekly downloads", variant = "h6", gutterBottom = TRUE),
  Typography("5.8M", variant = "h3", fontWeight = "bold")
)
```

Material UI's component library makes customization intuitive. Just compose components like building blocks.

#### Flexible Navigation

With the [reactRouter](https://felixluginbuhl.com/reactRouter/) R package, you can build a complex and multi-page websites thanks to [client-side routing](https://felixluginbuhl.com/muiMaterial/articles/routing.html).

You are not blocked in standardized Shiny layouts, like in Bootstrap's based R packages such as `bslib` or `bs4Dash`.

#### Rich Ecosystem

Extend functionality with companion R packages:

- muiDataGrid (COMING SOON) - Professional data tables with filtering, sorting, and inline editing
- muiCharts (COMING SOON) - Beautiful, responsive charts
- muiDateTimePickers (COMING SOON) - UI components for selecting dates, times, and ranges
- [muiTreeView](https://felixluginbuhl.com/muiTreeView/) - Interactive tree navigation

## Quick start

#### Installation

```r
#remotes::install_github("lgnbhl/reactRouter") # dev version
install.packages("muiMaterial")
```

#### Your first Material UI app

```r
library(shiny)
library(muiMaterial)

ui <- muiMaterialPage(
  CssBaseline(
    Box(
      sx = list(p = 2),
      Typography("Hello Material UI!", variant = "h4")
    )
  )
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

**Important**: Use `muiMaterialPage()` instead of `fluidPage()` and wrap your UI in `CssBaseline()` to ensure proper styling. Material UI uses its own design system and conflicts with Bootstrap.

#### Shiny Input Wrappers

Material UI components become Shiny inputs with `*.shinyInput()` wrappers. For example, use `Button.shinyInput()` instead of `Button()` to capture user interactions in Shiny.

Explore available Shiny inputs with app live [here](https://lgnbhl-muimaterial-showcase.share.connect.posit.cloud/):

```r
muiMaterial::muiMaterialExample("showcase")
```

#### Server side Shiny rendering

When rendering components from the server, use `shiny::renderUI()` or `shiny.react::renderReact()` in your server function, and `shiny::uiOutput()` or `shiny.react::reactOutput()` in your UI.

#### Creating tabs

Use `TabContext.shinyInput()`, `TabList.shinyInput()`, and `TabPanel.shinyInput()` instead of the basic `Tabs()` component (which currently doesn't work). [See full example](https://github.com/lgnbhl/muiMaterial/blob/main/inst/examples/Tabs.R).

For more advanced use cases, it is preferabe to use client-side routing with [reactRouter](https://felixluginbuhl.com/reactRouter/).

#### Styling with sx

Customize any component using the `sx` argument for inline CSS-in-JS styling. It's more powerful and maintainable than traditional CSS.
